You have an idea that you want to share with the world!

With a little time and know-how, you can use the web to share your idea all over the world, almost instantaneously.

These lesson's will give you the know-how. Going step-by-step through the basics.

All you need is a computer with a text editor and a web browser, some time, and of course -- an idea.

## What you will learn

A web page is built on a few common technologies, and we will cover them all (though we will only begin to scratch the surface of what is capable with JavaScript):

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for organizing our content
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for making our content look nice
- JavaScript for adding interactivity to our web page

Each of these technologies work within most modern day web browsers, so you won't need access to a web server to follow along. (More advanced lessons will teach you about things you can do on the server using various databases and server side web technologies like PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js).

## What you will need

As I mentioned above, you don't need too much to become a web developer, just a computer that can run a modern web browser: the latest version of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), [Safari](http://www.google.com/chrome/), or [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie) will all suffice (you probably already have at least one of these on your computer right now).

You'll also want a text editor.

A text editor specializes in working with plain, unformatted text. Word Processors (like Microsoft Word) will not work! While a text editor can be a very personal decision. To get started you may try one of these:

- [Notepad ++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows users. This is a powerful free text editor that you can grow into.
- [TextWangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) for Mac users \[[AppStore Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395#)\]. This is BBEdit's "little brother" while it lacks some of BBEdits features, it will be fine for our purposes.
- `vi` or `emacs` if you are using Unix/Linux or a related OS. One or both of these text editors may already be present on your computer (for example, these exist in Mac OS X). Explaining how to use these however is a different discussion altogether.

Once you have everything ready to go, then we can begin...
