# Learn Web Dev

## Getting started creating web pages with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This book will teach the basics of web development to readers with little to no experience in web development (or any development). While there is an assumption that the reader is a competent computer user, and has a desire to learn web development, little else is assumed.

*Learn Web Dev* will not only teach the readers to build exciting, attractive web pages, but will also provide a good foundation for any future computer development that the reader wishes to tackle.
