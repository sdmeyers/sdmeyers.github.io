*Why am I here?*

Good question.

Most of the stuff here are little bit of knowledge that I come across in my day-to-day work and play that might be interesting to you, but more likely is interesting to me. I post these things here as sort of a notebook of reminders so if I ever encounter the same or a similar issue, I have a solution, or at least a place to start. If you, my dear reader, happen to find one of these bits useful, that great, glad I could help.

*There seems to be no frequent updates and the organization is a bit of a mess*

Well, as this stuff is here mostly for my benefit, I'll add and organize things as the need arises, but I'm not making any promises that anything here will be what you are looking for. YMMV.
